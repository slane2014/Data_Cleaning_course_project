The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket 
of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have 
been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the 
training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise 
filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap 
(128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body 
motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration 
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 
features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 
'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
*Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated 
body acceleration.
*Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
*A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
*Its activity label. 
*An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial 
raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) 
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter 
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration 
signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter 
with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to 
obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these 
three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, 
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
